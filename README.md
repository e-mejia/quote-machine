#  Quote-machine

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT: 

A random quote generator project that calls an API to generate the quotes.
Three components are used:

- Quote
- Newquote 
- Icons

With each new quote, a random color is used to represent the new quote.
Data is passed as props to the individual components.

#  How's it made 

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS

Incorporated the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript.  ReactJS was then used to build the application via components.  

The fetch function is used to call the API.

The app uses the useEffect React hook to initialize the page. 

#  Optimizations

  An image can be added that can provide a deeper connection with the quote.
